# Higher Protocol  
*A Proof-of-Progress issuance protocol for people aiming higher*

---

## 1. Intent

**Higher** exists to reward real, measurable human progress.

The original Higher token captured a powerful idea—*aiming higher* in athletics, business, creativity, and personal growth—but over time, momentum slowed. Not because the idea failed, but because the system lacked a durable, scalable way to **continuously incentivize progress**.

The **Higher Protocol** is an attempt to correct that.

Instead of one-off initiatives, grants, or missions, Higher becomes a **protocol**:  
a system that **issues tokens to people as they demonstrably move upward**—numerically, verifiably, and permanently.

If Bitcoin issues coins for expended compute,  
**Higher issues coins for expended effort that results in real progress.**

## 2. Origin & Why This Exists Now

### The Higher Story So Far
- Higher launched on Base through a Farcaster-native community
- Early traction, strong cultural resonance
- Governance via PartyDAO helped bootstrap launch
- Over time:
  - Governance became passive
  - Initiatives (missions) worked, but didn’t compound
  - Treasury constraints limited long-term ambition

### higher.zip (Founding Stewards)
- A small group (the “squad”) organized under **higher.zip**
- Shipped real things:
  - A permanently locked LP (“Permapool”)
  - Fee-funded initiatives
  - Multiple creative missions
- Clear realization:
  - Tactical execution wasn’t enough
  - The opportunity is **protocol-level**, not campaign-level

### The Inflection Point
Higher doesn’t need more prompts.  
It needs a **native economic engine** aligned with its values.

That engine is the **Higher Protocol**.

---

## 3. The Core Idea: Proof of Progress

### The Primitive: Pursuits

A **pursuit** is a commitment to aim higher, expressed as a **monotonic number**.

Examples:
- Weight lost (total lbs)
- Revenue earned
- Units sold
- Events hosted
- Miles run
- Articles published

**Key invariant:**  
> All pursuit values can only go **up**.

Progress is cumulative. What’s achieved cannot be undone.

---

### Updates & Proofs

- Participants submit **on-chain updates** as progress occurs
- Each update increments the pursuit’s value
- Optional **proofs** can be attached:
  - Links
  - Photos
  - Screenshots
  - Attestations
  - Other evidence

Proofs are social + economic signals, not absolute truth machines.

---

### Verification (Human, Not Mechanical)

Progress is verified by **Higher Protocol Governance**.

This group functions analogously to:
- Bitcoin miners
- Ethereum validators

…but instead of validating blocks, they validate **claims of progress**.

They decide:
- Whether an update is valid
- Whether proof is sufficient
- Whether issuance should occur

---

### Issuance (Mining, Reimagined)

When a pursuit update is verified:
- **Higher tokens are issued** to the participant
- Tokens come from the **Higher treasury**
- Issuance is **contextual**, not fixed

Governance can decide:
- How much Higher is issued per increment
- Whether milestones trigger step-ups
- Whether certain pursuits are weighted more heavily

Examples:
- +1 major conference hosted → large issuance
- +1 unit sold → smaller issuance
- Doubling a metric → bonus issuance

This is **human-judged mining**.

---

## 4. Governance

### Higher Protocol Governance (Not Just higher.zip)

- higher.zip is the **founding steward group**
- The end state is **Higher Protocol Governance**
- Governance is expected to **expand beyond the initial squad**

### Structure
- Members have **weights**: 1, 2, or 3
- Weight determines influence over:
  - Pursuit inclusion
  - Update validation
  - Issuance parameters
  - Treasury control
  - Governance membership changes

### What Governance Controls
- Which pursuits are eligible for issuance
- Validation / invalidation of updates
- How much Higher is issued per unit of progress
- Treasury flows
- Fee routing

Governance is explicitly **active**, not symbolic.

---

## 5. Economics & Treasury

### Relaunch Motivation
The current Higher token:
- Is already distributed
- Lacks sufficient treasury for long-term issuance

**Solution:** Relaunch Higher with a meaningful treasury and native protocol economics.

---

### Clanker as the Substrate

Higher is proposed to relaunch using the **Clanker protocol**, which enables:

- A **vault-based treasury**
- Native fee capture
- Governance-controlled distributions
- Superchain compatibility (Base → Optimism → Ethereum mainnet)

---

### Migration Mechanics (High-Level)

1. Existing Higher holders deposit into an **upgrade contract**
2. Liquidity is batch-extracted from the old market
3. A new Higher token is launched with that liquidity
4. Depositors become eligible to **claim the new Higher**
5. Treasury is instantiated as a **Clanker vault**
6. Governance contract controls:
   - Treasury
   - Fee streams
   - Distributions

This creates a clean **protocol genesis** while preserving community ownership.

---

### Paying Governance

Governance members are compensated for real labor:

- **ETH**
  - From LP trading fees
- **Higher**
  - Which can be recycled back into pursuits

This creates a sustainable loop:
- Trading → ETH fees
- ETH → governance compensation
- Governance → issuance
- Issuance → usage and liquidity

---

## 6. Scale, Fees, and Rate Limiting

### The Scaling Reality
- Governance is human
- Pursuits could be massive in number

### Solution
Fees (denominated in Higher) may be introduced for:
- Making a pursuit eligible for issuance
- Requesting validation
- Updating issuance-earning pursuits

Importantly:
- **Aiming higher is always free**
- **Earning issuance is gated**

Fees act as:
- Spam prevention
- Congestion control
- Labor compensation alignment

Exact mechanics are intentionally left open for iteration.

---

## 7. What This Is Not

- Not a jobs platform
- Not a hiring marketplace
- Not retroactive public goods funding
- Not a DAO that votes on vibes
- Not a merit badge system

This is a **protocol for issuing value against progress**.

---

## 8. Next Steps

### 1. Community Proposal on Farcaster
- Publish this concept publicly
- Frame it as:
  - A continuation, not a repudiation
  - An evolution of Higher’s original ethos
- Invite:
  - Critique
  - Edge cases
  - Objections
  - Alternative designs

### 2. Signal via Opt-In Deposits (Pre-Migration)
- Open **non-binding, opt-in deposits**
- Purpose:
  - Measure real interest
  - Not force commitment
  - Gather signal with skin in the game
- This is a **barometer**, not a launch

### 3. Iterate in Public
- Adjust governance shape
- Refine pursuit mechanics
- Pressure-test issuance logic
- Incorporate feedback before finalizing migration

## Closing Thought

Higher started as an idea.

The Higher Protocol turns it into a **system**—one that rewards people not for speculation, but for **becoming more than they were yesterday**.

If Bitcoin measures work in hashes,  
Higher measures work in **results**.

This proposal is an invitation to build that system together.
